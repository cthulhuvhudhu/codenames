Use a theme that encourages empathy and understanding: One way to encourage empathy and understanding is to use a theme that is focused on social justice, human rights, or other topics that promote empathy and understanding. For example, the word list could include words related to different cultures, religions, or social issues. This would require players to think about perspectives other than their own and to consider the experiences and viewpoints of others.

Use personal stories as clues: Instead of using one-word clues, the spymaster could use personal stories or anecdotes to describe the words on the grid. This would require players to listen actively and attentively to the story and to consider the connections between the story and the words on the grid. For example, the spymaster might tell a story about a time when they felt excluded or discriminated against, and the players would need to connect that story to the words on the grid.

Play with mixed teams: Another way to encourage empathy and understanding is to mix up the teams so that players are working with people they might not usually play with. This would require players to listen actively and to consider different communication styles and perspectives. Mixed teams could also help players to build relationships with people they might not otherwise interact with.

Use reflective listening: After each turn, players could be required to summarize and reflect on what they heard from their teammates. This would help players to develop active listening skills and to consider other perspectives. Reflective listening could also help players to build empathy and understanding by forcing them to consider other people's thoughts and feelings.
